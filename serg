"SARGABLE" stands for "Search ARGument ABLE", and it refers to a query or query condition that can take advantage of indexes in a database. When a query is SARGABLE, it means the database engine can efficiently use an index to filter records, rather than performing a full table scan. This leads to faster query performance.

For a query or condition to be SARGABLE, it generally needs to:

Avoid functions on the column: When you use a function on a column in a condition (e.g., WHERE LOWER(column_name) = 'value'), the database engine can't use an index on that column efficiently.

Use comparison operators that are index-friendly: Operators like =, >, <, >=, and <= are typically index-friendly. Operators like LIKE can be index-friendly if used appropriately (e.g., column_name LIKE 'value%' is SARGABLE, but column_name LIKE '%value%' is not).

Avoid non-SARGABLE constructs: Certain SQL constructs, like OR conditions that span multiple columns, might render a query non-SARGABLE. For instance, WHERE column1 + column2 = value might prevent the use of an index.

Avoid implicit conversions: If you're comparing a column of one datatype to a value of a different datatype, the database may need to perform a conversion, which can prevent efficient index usage.

The primary goal with SARGABLE queries is to allow the query optimizer to use indexes effectively, which greatly enhances performance. When writing or optimizing SQL queries, it's beneficial to be aware of these concepts and ensure that conditions are as SARGABLE as possible.

Use joins appropriately: It's preferable to use standard joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) instead of old-style comma-separated joins or WHERE-based joins. Proper join syntax tends to be more readable and can often be optimized better.

Beware of NULL: Operations involving NULL can sometimes be non-SARGABLE. For instance, IS NULL and IS NOT NULL are usually SARGABLE, but expressions like column_name + NULL might complicate optimization.

Subqueries: Subqueries in the WHERE clause, especially correlated subqueries, can be a potential source of performance problems. Whenever possible, it's generally more efficient to rewrite these using joins.

Avoid using NOT IN: This can sometimes be rewritten using a LEFT JOIN to achieve better performance.

Constant expressions: While this doesn't affect SARGABILITY directly, it's a good practice to pre-calculate constant expressions rather than letting the database do it repeatedly.

Use indexed views: In some database systems, you can create indexed views that pre-calculate complex queries. By querying the view instead of the base tables, you can potentially take advantage of these pre-calculations.

Maintain statistics: This isn't about writing SARGABLE queries per se, but it's essential to ensure the database's statistics are up-to-date. The query optimizer relies on these statistics to decide the best way to execute a query.

Evaluate OR conditions: While OR conditions can sometimes make a query non-SARGABLE, using UNION or UNION ALL might be a way to rewrite the query for better performance, though it can be more verbose.

Indexed Columns Order: The order in which columns appear in a composite index can influence SARGABILITY. For instance, if you have an index on (A, B) and your query's WHERE clause filters on B without mentioning A, the index may not be used optimally.

Avoid Wildcard Characters at the Start: For databases that support wildcard searches using LIKE, placing the wildcard at the beginning of a search string (e.g., LIKE '%value') makes the query non-SARGABLE. Instead, using the wildcard at the end (e.g., LIKE 'value%') is generally SARGABLE.

Temporary Tables and Table Variables: In some situations, breaking a complex query into steps and using temporary tables or table variables can improve performance, even though this involves additional writes and reads.

Partitioning: Using table partitioning can improve performance by allowing the database to skip over entire partitions that are irrelevant to a query. Though not directly about SARGABILITY, it affects how data is read, which is the essence of SARGABLE queries.

Avoid Distinct: The DISTINCT keyword can sometimes be replaced by a GROUP BY, which might offer better performance in certain cases.

Database-Specific Functions: Be aware of database-specific functions or features. Each database system may have its own quirks or optimizations. For instance, SQL Server has OPTION (RECOMPILE), which can help in certain scenarios where parameter sniffing causes issues.

Column Data Type Consistency: Ensure that the data types of columns being compared or joined on are consistent. Implicit conversions due to data type mismatches can hamper performance.

Consider Materialized Views: Some databases support materialized views (or similar constructs), which store the result of a query and can be refreshed periodically. Queries against these views can be much faster since the data is pre-computed.

Avoid Multi-Column Updates: If you're updating multiple columns, try to ensure that only the columns that have changed are updated. This is more about reducing I/O and log activity than SARGABILITY but can significantly impact performance.

Parameterization: Using parameterized queries not only prevents SQL injection but can also allow the database to reuse execution plans, leading to faster query performance.

IN vs. EXISTS: Sometimes, using EXISTS can be more efficient than using IN, especially when checking for the existence of rows in subqueries.

Optimize Data Models: The design of the database, like normalization, can influence query performance. Denormalized tables might offer faster read operations at the expense of more complex writes.

Reduce Transaction Scope: Large transactions can lock resources for longer durations. By minimizing the scope of transactions, you can reduce contention and improve performance.

Opt for Covering Indexes: A covering index includes all the columns required to process a particular query. If a query can be satisfied entirely using the index without accessing the table, it's usually faster.

Evaluate Fetching Strategies: Depending on the use case, fetching more data in fewer round trips (e.g., using larger result sets) might be more efficient than fetching smaller amounts of data more frequently.
